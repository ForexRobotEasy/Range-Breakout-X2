# Range Breakout X2

Range Breakout X2 is a forex trading algorithm developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This algorithm is designed to identify key levels of support and resistance and establish trades based on these levels. It also includes features such as customizable levels based on market volatility and an adjustable trailing stop.

## How It Works

The algorithm begins by identifying the daily key levels of support and resistance. These levels are stored in global variables `supportLevels` and `resistanceLevels`. The specific code for identifying these levels is not provided in this sample code.

Once the key levels are identified, the algorithm proceeds to establish trades based on these levels. It loops through the support levels and checks if the current price is below a support level. If it is, it opens a long trade using the `Trade.OpenMarketOrder` function, specifying the trade type as `POSITION_TYPE_BUY` and the trade symbol as `Symbol()`. The trade volume is determined by the `Lots` variable, and the trade entry price is either the current Ask price or the current Bid price, depending on the trade type. The trade comment is set to 'Range Breakout X2'.

Similarly, the algorithm loops through the resistance levels and checks if the current price is above a resistance level. If it is, it opens a short trade using the `Trade.OpenMarketOrder` function, specifying the trade type as `POSITION_TYPE_SELL` and the other parameters as mentioned above.

After establishing trades, the algorithm allows for customization of the levels based on market volatility. The `CustomizeLevels` function is called with a boolean parameter `activateLevels`. If `activateLevels` is `true`, the code inside the function activates levels based on market volatility. If `activateLevels` is `false`, the code deactivates levels based on market volatility. The specific code for activating and deactivating levels is not provided in this sample code.

The algorithm also includes an adjustable trailing stop feature. The `AdjustableTrailingStop` function is called to implement this feature. The specific code for implementing the adjustable trailing stop is not provided in this sample code.

Finally, the algorithm concludes with any additional code that may be required to complete its logic.

## Product Description

Range Breakout X2 is a forex trading algorithm developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify key levels of support and resistance and establish trades based on these levels. The algorithm is compatible with the Forex Trading platform and can be used to enhance trading strategies.

With Range Breakout X2, traders can take advantage of breakouts from support and resistance levels, potentially capturing significant market movements. The algorithm automatically identifies the key levels and opens trades accordingly, making it suitable for both experienced and novice traders.

In addition to its breakout trading capabilities, Range Breakout X2 offers customizable levels based on market volatility. Traders can activate or deactivate levels depending on market conditions, allowing for adaptive trading strategies.

Another notable feature of Range Breakout X2 is its adjustable trailing stop. This feature enables traders to protect their profits and maximize gains by dynamically adjusting the stop loss level as the trade progresses.
